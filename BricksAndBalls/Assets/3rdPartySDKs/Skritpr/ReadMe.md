## Skrptr Ui Builder

Skrptr UI Builder is copyright of (c) Radu-Adrian Marcu // FairyMental

#### Get Started

1. Download, import and setup DoTween (Free on Assetstore) for Skrptr to be functional. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676
2. If you are **not** using assembly definitions, **delete Skrptr/Scripts/SkrptrAsmDef** file.
3. Open the example scene, and read the documentation (Skrptr/Documentation(Please read me)).

#### Important notes:

1. Ensure you have a SkrptrManager Prefab in your scene if you wish to use it.
2. Skrptr is as modular as it can become, it is now up to you how you set your elements to interact with each other based on the provided events.
3. If you need further components developed, feel free to e-mail me at fairy_mental@yahoo.com or message me on fiverr: https://www.fiverr.com/fairymental
